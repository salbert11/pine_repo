## About Pinescript

[Pinescript](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v5/)  is a proprietary scripting language developed by TradingView specifically for creating custom indicators, strategies, and libraries within their platform. With Pinescript, traders can develop their own unique technical analysis tools, automate trading strategies, and share reusable code components with the community.

This repository focuses on Pinescript code snippets, indicators, strategies, and libraries that I have developed for TradingView. Feel free to explore the repository, experiment with the code, and integrate it into your own trading strategies.
## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```

â”œâ”€â”€ indicators/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ indicator1.pine
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ indicator2.pine
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ strategies/

- The `indicators/` directory contains various Pinescript indicator files that can be added to your TradingView charts. These indicators provide additional insights and visualizations to assist in technical analysis. Refer to the [indicators/README.md](./README.md)  file for more information about each indicator. 
- The `strategies/` directory contains Pinescript strategy files. These files contain algorithmic trading strategies that can be backtested and executed within the TradingView platform. Refer to the [strategies/README.md](./README.md)  file for more information about each strategy. 
- The `libraries/` directory contains Pinescript library files. These files contain reusable code components that can be used across multiple indicators and strategies. Refer to the [libraries/README.md](./README.md)  file for more information about each library.
